A custom post type for choosing images and content which outputs Bootstrap Image Carousel (slider) from the [image-carousel] shortcode.

== Description ==

A custom post type for choosing images and content which outputs a [carousel](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel) from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) using the shortcode `[image-carousel]`. 

The plugin assumes that you're already using Bootstrap, so you need to load the Bootstrap javascript and CSS separately.

* [Download Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html)
* [Bootstrap WordPress Theme](http://320press.com/wpbs/)
* [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) _(hotlink CSS and javascript files)_
* [Bootstrap Carousel in action](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/examples/carousel.html)

I may consider adding an option to load the Bootstrap files in the future if there is demand. Let me know if you'd like it!

If you'd like to contribute to this plugin, you can find it [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/tallphil/cpt-bootstrap-carousel).
